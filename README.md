The aim of this project is to model the classic sudoku game and develop a solver based on the backtracking algorithm.

An interface for the state of progress of the solver is envisaged, so that the evolution of the algorithm can be followed graphically.

The project is based on the Go language. It also allows you to test certain features provided by the language, such as benchmark tests, fuzzing and documentation.
